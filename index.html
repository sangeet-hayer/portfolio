                <br>
                <p>Sangeet is a highly motivated student in the Information Technology program at Greater Lowell Technical High School. Her skills extend past simply programming, however. She’s been creating graphics for programs much longer than she’s been writing them. Her 5th grade class began a classification project that extended all the way up until 8th grade, in which she not only managed her team, but also helped them select which images were to be used, how to edit and organize the pieces they wanted to include, and how to work together despite conflicts. From a young age, she’s placed an influence on community and working together. She continues her education in programming and information technology in high school, and intends to pursue a career in stem once she reaches college, most likely some form of engineering. At the moment, she fills her time maintaining her honor roll record (with an astounding 4.4 gpa), babysitting, and swimming. </p>
                <br>
                <p>This portfolio is a summary of her achievements, including not only her resume, certifications, and work samples, but also images of the different extracurricular activities she’s involved in, and how she still finds a way to give back to her community. </p>
